HR Analytics Dashboard:- 
I designed an HR Analytics Dashboard in Power BI that transforms static workforce data into an interactive decision tool for HR teams.

3 Pages of Clarity:

1. Overview: 
8,950 employees, 9.7% attrition, department growth, location info and yearly trends in seconds.

2. Analysis: 
Drill into education, age, performance, Job roles and salary (avg $71K, tenure 4.9 yrs). Finance & IT Managers lead with $125K and $114K.

3. Employee Details: 
Fully searchable—filter by department, salary, or education to explore workforce patterns.

Built for interaction:
 1. Navigation & Filter buttons
 2. Custom Info pop-ups
 3. 11 tooltip pages with mini visual dashboards
 4. Auto-adjusting layout for clean, responsive design


Why I built it :-
Traditional HR reports are dump data; this one tells stories. Each visual reveals what drives attrition, pay gaps, or hiring surges—without clutter.
Built in Power BI.
